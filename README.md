# Addressing Maji Ndogo water crisis 
This project involved leveraging SQL on a 60,000-record database.
Through SQL functions and advanced tools, insights were extracted, 
and the crisis's scale was unveiled via aggregation. 
Integration of diverse data sources contributed to actionable insights. 
The final analysis, encompassing findings on the Maji Ndogo water crisis 
as well as the suitable solution, was efficiently concluded using SQL tools.

+ Part 1: Explored the dataset, identified unique water sources,
analysed visit patterns, and addressed pollution issues
by correcting and updating data in the water quality table using SQL operations.

+ Part 2: Performed data cleaning, identified top-performing employees
who completed the survey task. Explored the water source location,
assessed the water crisis scope, utilized window functions for repair solutions,
analysed queues to identify water collection points,
and generated a pivot table summarizing the findings.

+ Part 3: Generated an Entity-Relationship Diagram (ERD),
integrated the auditor report for analysis, and joined employee data to enhance the insights.
Additionally, constructed a complex query to gain a deeper understanding of the crises.

+ Part 4: Joined tables of interest, created views, and temporary tables to simplify analysis.
Employed advanced SQL operations to analyse and derive final insights,
culminating in the generation of a summary report.
